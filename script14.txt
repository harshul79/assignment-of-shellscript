Exercise_14 - Write the shell script that renames all files in the current directory that end in “.jpg” to begin with today’s date in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. For example, if a picture of my cat was in the current directory and today was October 31,2016 it would change name from “mycat.jpg” to “2016–10–31-mycat.jpg”.
#!/bin/bash
DAY=$(date +%F)
cd /home/vimukthi/Pictures
for FILE in *.png
 do
    mv $FILE ${DAY}-${FILE}
 done
